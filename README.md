### Introduction
Train accidents are not as common as other transportation accidents, which perhaps is why they are not viewed as a major threat.  Although railroads are not used as often as they were in centuries past, they remain quite active in transporting goods and people.  In fact, trains are still quite common in the United Statesâ€”particularly subways and commuter trains utilizing approximately 600 railroads, hundreds of thousands of miles of tracks, and over 200,000 railroad crossings. Unfortunately, when train accidents happen, they often result in serious injuries and fatalities.  

This map hopes to inform rail safety outreach groups and public safety agencies about the spatial distribution of train accidents in the United States and provide a way to explore this data in the map. The user will be provided with information pertaining to the cause of the accident, financial loss due to the accident, injuries, accidents caused by the accident, and any safety changes made after the accident. 

### Final Proposal Outline
1. Persona/Scenario 
    1. Rail Safety Educator
        * Gary is an outreach coordinator for Operation Lifesaver, a non-profit public safety education and awareness organization, and is interested in being able to identify where and when rail accidents occur and describe the nature of the accident in the locations where he gives outreach presentations. By using this application, he will develop insights related to the occurrence and causation of rail accidents that he will use in his presentations and provide advice on how to avoid similar accidents in the future. He has experience with some slippy map programs
    2. Scenario
        * The educator has the general goal of making people aware of the dangers around trains and to heed warning signs and signals.  When the user sees the interface, they form an intention of identifying where rail accidents occur in the location of their interest.  The user then specifies an action to enter the city name of their interest. The user then executes the action by entering the information and clicking a submission button. The user starts to perceive that some of the system has changed. They see the map and statistics populate and suddenly change. They start to evaluate the changes in the system. They notice how many rail accidents are in their area and interpret what that means. The user executes and evaluates the outcome finding that they need more information about the accidents on the map, so they click the points to obtain more details pertaining to the accident. 
        
2. Requirements Document (comprehensive...no page limit)
    1. Representation
        * data sources
        * basemap tileset
        * abbreviated title for the layers
        * description of proposed symbolization
    2. Interaction
        * each unique interface widget as a separate row
        *   abbreviated title for the function
        *   coding by operator and operand 
        *   description of the proposed interaction behavior and UI design

3. Lo-fi Wireframes
    *   series of wireframes that walk through use case scenario
    *   demonstrate layout of proposed functionality
    *   separate wireframe must be created for every new view generated in the use case scenario
    *   raw hand drawn sketches are fine for the draft proposal, but should be drawn more neatly for the final proposal
    *   use terminaology from the requirements document on the wireframe
