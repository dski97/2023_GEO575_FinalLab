### Team Members
1. Lisa Siewert
2. Dominic Cwalinski

### Final Proposal Outline
1. Persona/Scenario (1 page limit)
    1. Persona
        *description of a protoypical, target user
        *discussion of their interests and responsibilities
        *focus on their key needs-->needs should connect directly to lecture discussion of goals, objectives, operands, and insights
    2. Scenario
        *describes hypothetical interaction session with the proposed interactive map, working through multiple stages of interaction loops
        *relate the representation designs and interaction operators to user objectives using terminology from lecture
        
2. Requirements Document (comprehensive...no page limit)
    1. Representation
        *data sources
        *basemap tileset
        *abbreviated title for the layers
        *description of proposed symbolization
    2. Interaction
        *each unique interface widget as a separate row
        *abbreviated title for the function
        *coding by operator and operand 
        *description of the proposed interaction behavior and UI design

3. Lo-fi Wireframes
    *series of wireframes that walk through use case scenario
    *demonstrate layout of proposed functionality
    *separate wireframe must be created for every new view generated in the use case scenario
    *raw hand drawn sketches are fine for the draft proposal, but should be drawn more neatly for the final proposal
    *use terminaology from the requirements document on the wireframe
